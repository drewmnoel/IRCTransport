[CHAT] IRCTransport 0.11.1 - Minecraft Chat/IRC Integration
=============================================================

This [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) plugin replaces minecraft chat system with a connection to an IRC Server.  All IRC Connections happen Bukkit server side, so either run your own IRC server, or make sure that you are allowed to use mutiple connections on the IRC server of your choice.

Available settings:
-------------------
Put these in IRCTransport/plugin.yml file with appropriate values.


    verbose: false
    suppress:
      initial_userlist: false
      initial_topic: false
    server:
      address: localhost
      port: 6667
      password: server_password
    default:
      prefix: MC-
      suffix: -IRC
      channels:
        - channel: '#minecraft'
          key: channel_password
         - channel: '#help'

The server address  setting is mandatory.  All other settings are optional.

### Normal Settings
Your config.yml will look a lot like this:

    server:
      address: irc.example.com
    default:
      channels:
        - channel: '#minecraft' 

Available commands:
-------------------
